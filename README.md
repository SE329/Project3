Code Warriors - Project 3 - Degree Forward v2

There are a few improvements, including moving logic code to the back end, adding an authentication system with making new plans and loading old ones, and several style changes. Unfortunately, the degrees that were in here before were lost in transition, so there aren't many things to examine with this version. In all, we didn't have near enough time to do much, with projects and other classwork to deal with.
